# Homework1
The purpose of this project was to get used to calling classes and using methods for object orienting.
For the car class, there are attributes such as model, year, manufacturer, mileage, engine, drivetrain, transmission, mpg, exterior_color, interior_color, accidents, price, and new_price. For the methods, this one has paint, repair, reupholster, drive, and modifying the price of the car. Some limitations I have are in the repair section with three if statements and two if/else statement in the modifying price section.
For seller class, the attributes were name and rating. For the methods, this one has buy and sell. There is one limitation in each of those being one if statement
